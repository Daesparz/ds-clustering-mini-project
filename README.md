# Customer Segmentation using Clustering
 
The dataset contains information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent to customers) and transaction level data from customers. The transactional data shows which offer customers responded to, and what the customer ended up buying. The data is presented as the Excel workbook [WineKMC.xlsx](./WineKMC.xlsx), containing two worksheets. Each worksheet contains a different dataset.

We apply the Elbow Sum-of-Squares and the Silhouette Methods to choose the best parameter K for K-Means Clustering. PCA is used to visualize clusters, and another clustering techniques are discussed, as spectral, agglomerative clustering and affinity propagation.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
- Run Anaconda Navigator and launch a jupyter notebook and open the file [Mini-Project-Clustering](./Mini_Project_Clustering.ipynb)

Packages applied in this project (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, sklearn) do not require installation (default packages in anaconda). They only need to be imported in the notebook.
